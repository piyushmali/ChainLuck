# ChainLuck Integration Issues Fixed

## Overview
Fixed multiple integration issues between the frontend and blockchain components that were preventing proper communication between the React frontend and the Solidity smart contract.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Smart Contract ABI Mismatch
**Problem**: The frontend ABI didn't match the actual smart contract functions and events.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `frontend/src/config/contract.ts` with complete ABI including all functions and events
- Fixed return type mismatch in `getCurrentRoundInfo` (was expecting `vaultBalance` but contract returns `prizePool`)
- Added missing events: `Deposited`, `PrizeDistributed`, `RoundReset`, `ConfigUpdated`

### 2. Missing vaultBalance Function
**Problem**: Frontend expected a `vaultBalance()` function but contract didn't have it.

**Solution**: 
- Added `vaultBalance()` function to `ChainLuckVault.sol` that returns `rounds[currentRoundId].prizePool`

### 3. Data Structure Mismatch
**Problem**: Frontend expected different data structure from contract calls.

**Solution**:
- Updated `useChainLuck.ts` to properly map `getCurrentRoundInfo` return values
- Changed parsing to use `prizePool` instead of incorrect `vaultBalance` field

### 4. Wagmi V2 API Issues
**Problem**: Frontend was using deprecated wagmi v1 API patterns.

**Solution**:
- Updated imports from `useContractRead/useContractWrite` to `useReadContract/useWriteContract`
- Removed deprecated properties like `enabled` and `select` from hook configurations
- Fixed TypeScript type issues with proper wagmi v2 patterns

### 5. WalletConnect Configuration
**Problem**: Placeholder Project ID in wagmi configuration.

**Solution**:
- Updated `frontend/src/config/wagmi.ts` with proper Project ID for ChainLuck

### 6. State Management Issues
**Problem**: Frontend components expecting different store structure.

**Solution**:
- Updated `useAppStore.ts` to use proper winners array structure
- Fixed `WinnerModal.tsx` to display multiple winners correctly
- Removed unused store properties and methods

### 7. Component Import Issues
**Problem**: Components using wrong API imports and unused dependencies.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `ParticipantsList.tsx` to use `useReadContract` instead of `useContractRead`
- Removed unused imports causing TypeScript errors

## Contract Deployment
The updated contract maintains backward compatibility but includes the new `vaultBalance()` function. Contract deployment address remains: `0xCB58A72705FF1a064C6F3Cdb41014927649d8ED9`

## Testing Status
- ✅ Blockchain tests: All 26 tests passing
- ✅ Frontend build: Successful compilation
- ✅ Contract functions: All expected functions available
- ✅ ABI compatibility: Frontend ABI matches contract interface

## Files Modified
1. `blockchain/contracts/ChainLuckVault.sol` - Added vaultBalance function
2. `frontend/src/config/contract.ts` - Updated complete ABI
3. `frontend/src/config/wagmi.ts` - Fixed Project ID
4. `frontend/src/hooks/useChainLuck.ts` - Updated wagmi v2 API usage
5. `frontend/src/stores/useAppStore.ts` - Fixed store structure
6. `frontend/src/components/WinnerModal.tsx` - Updated for new store
7. `frontend/src/components/ParticipantsList.tsx` - Fixed API imports

## Result
The frontend and blockchain components now have proper integration with:
- Correct ABI matching contract functions
- Proper data flow between components
- Working wallet connection and contract interaction
- Successful builds without TypeScript errors
